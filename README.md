# Raycasting Engine in C using MiniLibX

## Description

This project implements a basic raycasting engine in C, leveraging the MiniLibX library for graphical rendering. The goal is to simulate a 3D-like environment using 2D raycasting techniques.

Game Features

    2D Map Representation: The environment is represented by a 2D map grid, with walls, spaces, and other elements.
    Raycasting for 3D rendering: The engine uses raycasting to simulate the 3D view of the environment.
    Dynamic movement: The player can move around in the 2D map and view the surroundings in 3D-like projections.
    Basic textures: Simple wall textures can be used to enhance the visual representation.
    MiniLibX for graphics: All rendering and window handling is done using the MiniLibX library.
